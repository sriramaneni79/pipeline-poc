		<h2>Screen Printing </h2>
			
	
		<h3>Applications</h3>
			<p> 
			Screen printing is arguably the most versatile of all printing processes. It can be used to print on a wide variety of substrates, including paper, paperboard, plastics, glass, metals, fabrics, and many other materials. including paper, plastics, glass, metals, nylon and cotton. Some common products from the screen printing industry include posters, labels, decals, signage, and all types of textiles and electronic circuit boards. The advantage of screenprinting over other print processes is that the press can print on substrates of any shape, thickness and size.

A significant characteristic of screen printing is that a greater thickness of the ink can be applied to the substrate than is possible with other printing techniques. This allows for some very interesting effects that are not possible using other printing methods. Because of the simplicity of the application process, a wider range of inks and dyes are available for use in screen printing than for use in any other printing process.

Utilization of screenprinting presses has begun to increase because production rates have improved. This has been a result of the development of the automated and rotary screenprinting press, improved dryers, and U.V. curable ink. The major chemicals used include screen emulsions, inks, and solvents, surfactants, caustics and oxidizers used in screen reclamation. The inks used vary dramatically in their formulations (GATF 1992b).

		<h2> Screen Printing Process Overview</h2>
		
		<p>
		Screen printing consists of three elements: the screen which is the image carrier; the squeegee; and ink. The screen printing process uses a porous mesh stretched tightly over a frame made of wood or metal. Proper tension is essential to accurate color registration. The mesh is made of porous fabric or stainless steel mesh. A stencil is produced on the screen either manually or photochemically. The stencil defines the image to be printed in other printing technologies this would be referred to as the image plate.

Screen printing ink is applied to the substrate by placing the screen over the material. Ink with a paint-like consistency is placed onto the top of the screen. Ink is then forced through the fine mesh openings using a squeegee that is drawn across the scree, applying pressure thereby forcing the ink through the open areas of the screen. Ink will pass through only in areas where no stencil is applied, thus forming an image on the printing substrate. The diameter of the threads and the thread count of the mesh will determine how much ink is deposited onto the substrates. 
More Information...


Many factors such as composition, size and form, angle, pressure, and speed of the blade (squeegee) determine the quality of the impression made by the squeegee. At one time most blades were made from rubber which, however, is prone to wear and edge nicks and has a tendency to warp and distort. While blades continue to be made from rubbers such as neoprene, most are now made from polyurethane which can produce as many as 25,000 impressions without significant degradation of the image.

If the item was printed on a manual or automatic screen press the printed product will be placed on a conveyor belt which carries the item into the drying oven or through the UV curing system. Rotary screen presses feed the material through the drying or curing system automatically. Air drying of certain inks, though rare in the industry, is still sometimes utilized.

The rate of screen printing production was once dictated by the drying rate of the screen print inks. Do to improvements and innovations the production rate has greatly increased. Some specific innovations which affected the production rate and has also increased screen press popularity include:.

Development of automatic presses versus hand operated presses which have comparatively slow production times.
Improved drying systems which significantly improves production rate.
Development and improvement of U.V. curable ink technologies
Development of the rotary screen press which allows continuous operation of the press. This is one of the more recent technology developments.

		<h2>Screen Preparation</h2>
		
		<P>
		
		Screen (or image transfer) preparation includes a number of steps. First the customer provides the screen printer with objects, photographs, text, ideas, or concepts of what they wish to have printed. The printer must then transfer a "picture" of the artwork (also called "copy") to be printed into an "image" (a picture on film) which can then be processed and eventually used to prepare the screen stencil.

Once the artwork is transferred to a positive image that will be chemically processed onto the screen fabric (applying the emulsion or stencil) and eventually mounted onto a screen frame that is then attached to the printing press and production begins.

		<h2>SCREEN MATERIALS AND PREPARATION OVERVIEW</h2>
		
		<p>
		Frames

There are two types of screen frames, metal and wood. Metal frames, both static (solid) and retentionable, have become the industry standard. Retentionables do not require the use of adhesive products.

Metal frames have been replaced by wood because they do not warp from water like wood frames do. The most commonly used types of wood are cedar and pine. Pine is preferred because it is more water resistant while it is light weight.

Metal screens are made out of aluminum or steel. Aluminum is commonly preferred because it is light weight, yet sturdy. There are some applications where steel is preferred such as very large printing frames used for long printing runs.

Fabric

Screen making - there are two types of threads for screen fabric:

Monofilament - single strands weaved into fabric
(view image)
primarily used in commercial printing and other applications
Advantage: Monofilament is easier to clean than multifilament
Multifilament - multiple strands wound together like a rope, then weaved into fabric
(view image)
primarily used in textile printing.
Disadvantage: ink tends to build up on screen, more difficult to clean Monofilament mesh has become the industry standard
Fabric Types

Today commercial screen printing primarily uses 4 types of fabric for making screens, silk, cotton organdie, nylon, and polyester. Silk was the original material used to make screens for screen printing. By far the most widely used fabric is monofilament polyester followed by multifilament polyester and nylon.

Silk - multifilament weave
loses taughtness with frequent use
reclaiming chemicals containing bleach or chlorinated solvents destroy the silk
today silk is primarily used for printing art, not commercial use as before
Cotton Organdie - multifilament weave
same disadvantages as silk
Nylon - multifilament or monofilament
good for stretching
compared to polyester, lacks stability
less rigid than polyester
unsuitable for closely registered colors
Polyester - multifilament or monofilament (calendared monofilament polyester, metallized monofilament polyester)
primary material used in commercial screen printing
Polyester is strong and stable when stretched
Other screen materials - carbonized polyester
glass
wire mesh
stainless steel
Screens made of the same material can differ in thread diameter, number of threads-per-inch, and choice of mono- or multifilament fibers. The need for various characteristics such as wearability and dimensional stability will help determine the fabric selected for a particular screen printing job. Diameter of mesh thread and number of threads per inch determine the amount of ink transferred to the substrate during the printing process (Buonicore and SPAI 1991).

Screen mesh

Screen mesh refers to the number of threads per inch of fabric. The more numerous the threads per inch the finer the screen.

Finer mesh will deposit a thinner ink deposit. This is a desirable affect when printing a very fine detail and halftones. Typically a fabric should be 200-260 threads per inch. Water based inks work best on finer mesh. These are generally used in graphic and industrial printing.

Course mesh will deposit a heavier ink deposit. This type of screen is used on flatter, open shapes. Typically a course screen mesh will be 160-180 threads per inch. These are generally used in textile printing.

"Emulsion" or "Stencils"

The words emulsion and stencil are used interchangeably in screenprinting.

Applying the emulsion is the chemical process of transferring image to a screen. The function of the emulsion (or stencil) is to cover the non-printing area of the screen. The stencil process works due to the use of a light sensitive material that hardens when exposed to ultraviolet light. The stencil material must be of a material that is impermeable to the screen printing ink.

Materials used for stencils include plain paper, shellac or lacquer coated paper, lacquer film, photographic film, and light-sensitive emulsions. Stencil types available include: hand-cut film, photographic film, direct coating, direct/indirect photostencil, and wet-direct photostencil.

The stencil is composed of either a liquid product that is poured onto the screen mesh or a film product. There are two types of photographic film, presensitized and unsensitized, available for use in the preparation of stencils. Presensitized film is ready to use as purchased, while unsensitized film must first be treated with a photosensitization solution.

In preparing the stencil, the film is exposed to a positive film image in a vacuum frame. It is then developed in a solution that renders the unexposed image areas soluble in water. The soluble areas are removed and the remaining film is bonded to the screen fabric.

There are four stencil application processes, hand cut, direct stencil and indirect stencil (application of a film):

Hand Cut

A hand-cut film stencil is made by hand cutting the image areas from a lacquer film sheet on a paper backing. A liquid adhesive is then used to bond the stencil to the screen fabric. Once the adhesive has dried, the film's paper backing sheet is removed.

Direct Stencil

In the direct coating process, a light-sensitive emulsion is applied to the entire screen using a scoop coater and allowed to dry. The screen is then exposed to a film positive image. The non-image areas of the emulsion harden upon exposure. However, the coating in the unexposed image areas remains soluble and is removed with a spray of warm water. Several coats of the light-sensitive material are applied and smoothed to achieve a long wearing screen.

Some of the characteristics of direct stencils are:

Most are water soluble
Wear better than indirect stencils
Cheaper to produce than indirect stencils
Two different types of direct stencil solution
Water-resistant stencil solution
Solvent-resistant stencil solution
Within direct stencil processes yellow and orange colored fabric is used for the screen mesh. The color prevents light from bouncing when the stencil is exposed to UV. If light bounces or scatters the exposure is uneven.

Indirect Stencil

The preparation of indirect stencils combines elements of both the photographic film and the direct coating methods. An unsensitized photographic film is laminated to the screen and then sensitized by the direct application of a photosensitive emulsion. The exposed stencil is processed in a manner similar to that used in the preparation of stencils produced by the photographic film and the direct coating methods. The indirect process produces highly durable stencils that are used in applications where high print quality is required.

Indirect Stencil process consists of using a coated acetate film which is cut into the exact shape of the artwork and adhered to the screen using water then is dried by heat. Some of the characteristics of Indirect Stencils are:

Produce excellent definition & finer detail
Best for Water-based ink printing
More difficult to remove from screen mesh, requires high pressure water rinse.
Wet-Direct Photostencil

A recent development in stencil preparation is the wet-direct photostencil process. To prepare a stencil using this process, a film positive is held in direct contact with a wet photopolymer emulsion. The emulsion hardens when exposed to UV light. The unexposed areas of emulsion are then removed yielding a very durable, high quality screen.

Screen Printing Prepress - Screen Making - Emulsion Application

Clean & Degrease Screen Mesh
putting tooth on mesh
The screen must first be thoroughly cleaned and degreased prior to applying emulsion (stencil). If not, the film stencil will not properly adhere to the screen resulting in parts of the stencil coming loose during printing and thus spoiling the finished product. The screen is then cleaned with warm water and cleaner/degreaser. Then, a pumice-based abrasive is used. These steps act to remove grease from the surface and roughens it so that the film stencil adheres well. This is called "putting tooth" on the mesh.

Apply emulsion/stencil
The process of exposing indirect and direct stencils is the same. A light-proof positive is made on a sheet of clear acetate to act as the positive image area of the screen. This is placed over the light-sensitive coating. A timed exposure to UV light is then made. The UV light hardens only the exposed parts of the film coating (negative areas); the areas of emulsion concealed beneath the positive image remain soft. A simple developer is then used to further harden the exposed parts of the film stencil. On washing the emulsion with warm water, the soft areas of film emulsion start to dissolve, finally disappearing to leave a negative stencil that is the exact opposite of the positive image. When printed, the result will be the exact likeness to the original positive image / artwork.

Emulsion Types

Water resistant emulsions 
Solvent based ink
UV curable ink
Water based ink - w/ chemical curing
Solvent resistant emulsions
Water based ink
UV curable ink
Water resistant emulsions are used in Direct Stencil processes and capillary film processes. Stencil or emulsion which is water-soluble is incompatible with water based ink. Solvent-based and UV curable inks can be used with water-resistant emulsions

Chemical curing of water-resistant emulsions using a HCl based solution can improve resistance to water and therefore can be used with water based inks. Screens made with water resistant emulsions are more difficult to reclaim/remove the stencil than solvent-resistant, but are very inexpensive. It also adds an extra step and use of additional chemicals.

Solvent resistant emulsions cam be used along with water based inks. Although solvent resistant emulsions are most compatible with water based ink systems, the use of solvent-resistant emulsions and water based inks cause the emulsion to quickly erode and create pin-holes. In order to avoid this problem screen printers can opt for water resistant emulsions with chemical curing.

There is no VOC or HAP emissions from screen emulsion products or the process of applying the emulsion to the screen.

		<h2>Screen Printing Presses</h2>
		<p>There are three types of screen printing presses. The flat-bed (probably the most widely used), cylinder, and rotary.</p>
		
		

		
		<p>
		FLAT-BED AND CYLINDER PRESSES

Flat-bed and cylinder presses are similar in that both use a flat screen and a three step reciprocating process to perform the printing operation. The screen is first moved into position over the substrate, the squeegee is then pressed against the mesh and drawn over the image area, and then the screen is lifted away from the substrate to complete the process. With a flat-bed press the substrate to be printed is positioned on a horizontal print bed that is parallel to the screen. With a cylinder press the substrate is mounted on a cylinder (Field and Buonicore).

ROTARY SCREEN PRESSES

Rotary screen presses are designed for continuous, high speed web printing. The screens used on rotary screen presses are seamless thin metal cylinders. The open-ended cylinders are capped at both ends and fitted into blocks at the side of the press. During printing, ink is pumped into one end of the cylinder so that a fresh supply is constantly maintained. The squeegee is a free floating steel bar inside the cylinder and squeegee pressure is maintained and adjusted by magnets mounted under the press bed. Rotary screen presses are most often used for printing textiles, wallpaper, and other products requiring unbroken continuous patterns.

		<h2>Screen Reclamation (post-press)</h2>
		
		<p>
		Why reclaim screens?

Polyester fabric costs $10-40 per square yard.

Failure to reclaim screens and ruined screens cost on average $5,000-$10,000 per year. The average monthly fabric cost $360. One study showed chemical reclamation cost between 2 and 10 dollars per average screen, while screen disposal cost just shy of 50 dollars.

The process of reclaiming screens generates solvent waste and waste water. Solvent waste generated from screen cleaning and waste water is generated through the process of emulsion removal. The waste water will contain particulates comprised of ink pigment, emulsion and emulsion remover (periodate).
		<br></br>
		RECLAIMING SCREENS INVOLVES 2 TO 3 STEPS.

1. Remove the ink:

Any and all excess ink in the screen should be "carded off" for reuse on another job. The screen must then be washed to remove any remaining ink because the ink will interfere with the process of removing the stencil. Screen cleaning solvents are a source of VOC emissions.

2. Emulsion removal:

The stencil or emulsion is removed by spraying the screen with a solution of water and emulsion remover chemicals which is comprised mainly of sodium metaperiodate. Then rinsing the solution away with fresh water.

The emulsion remover solution should not be permitted to dry on the surface of the screen. The emulsion and remover will become virtually impossible to remove if allowed to dry. Repeated rinsing will result in excess waste water that must be disposed of as a regulated waste and will not significantly improve the situation.

3. Haze or ghost image removal:

Finally, if any haze or "ghost image" remains, a haze remover must be applied. Some haze remover products are caustic and can damage or weaken the screen. Haze removers make screens brittle and tear easily, therefore only small amounts should be used. Ghost image is a shadow of the original image that remains on the screen caused by ink or stencil caught in the threads of the screen.

		<h2>Screen Printing Inks</h2>
		
		<p>
		Screen printing inks are moderately viscous inks which exhibit different properties when compared to other printing inks such as offset, gravure and flexographic inks though they have similar basic compositions (pigments, solvent carrier, toners, and emulsifiers). There are five different types of screen ink to include solvent, water, and solvent plastisol, water plastisol, and UV curable. 
		<br><br>
		UV CURABLE

UV curable inks consist of liquid prepolymers, monomers, and initiators which upon being exposed to large doses of U.V. Radiation instantly polymerize the vehicle to a dry, tough thermosetting resin. They also require less energy, overall, to dry or "cure" compared to gas or electric driers.

The down side of UV inks is they can cost as much as three times that of regular inks and must be handled differently than conventional inks due to safety issues. Additionally, solvents are required for clean-up which results in some VOC emissions.

PLASTISOL INKS

Plastisol inks (both solvent and water based) are used in textile screen printing.

SOLVENT INKS & WATER INKS

Solvent and water based screen printing inks are formulated with primarily solvent or water. The solvent evaporates and results in VOC emissions. Water based inks, though they contain significantly less, may still emit VOC’s from small amounts of solvent and other additives blended into the ink. The liquid waste material may also be considered hazardous waste.
